## I am Nandan Kumar

I am a full-time Software Developer, Public Speaker, and a part-time Photographer. I love to talk about Cybersecurity, Web Development, Accelerated Mobile Pages, Progressive Web Apps, Natural language Processing, Chatbots, etc.

My claim to fame was when I posted a series of tweets on Twitter about data privacy issues on an airlineâ€™s website and the tweet got viral for all the good reasons. The story was covered by all major media portals all around the world and I have been interviewed by some major radio channels and podcasts.

In my free time, I like to indulge myself in activities like Photography, Gardening, Snooker, or Boxing. I am a proud owner of many plants, I sometimes talk to them (mostly pep talks).
