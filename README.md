## I am Nandan Kumar

I am a full-time Software Developer, Public Speaker, and a part-time Photographer. I love to talk about Cybersecurity, Web Development, Accelerated Mobile Pages, Progressive Web Apps, Natural language Processing, Chatbots, etc.

My claim to fame was when I posted a series of tweets on Twitter about data privacy issues on an airline’s website and the tweet got viral for all the good reasons. The story was covered by all major media portals all around the world and I have been interviewed by some major radio channels and podcasts.

In my free time, I like to indulge myself in activities like Photography, Gardening, Snooker, or Boxing. I am a proud owner of many plants, I sometimes talk to them (mostly pep talks).
